**The MIC stack genesis!**

Proton is a high-level Python framework that facilitates rapid server-side development with clean & pragmatic design. 
Thanks for checking it out!

- Proton aims at easing server-side development for all Python enthusiasts. 
- Proton bootstraps templated backend by relying on code generating code with minimum dev effort. 
- A few CLI commands to setup production ready server side stack with managed DB connections <small>(Proton ships with postgresql)</small>, 
managed caching <small>(Proton ships with redis)</small>, managed JWT authenticated routes, descriptive logging, 
managed monitoring (Prometheus & Grafana) and auto-generated openAPI specs.
- Automates `signup` & `login` with necessaary validations.
- All of this, **containerised**

# Anatomy

# Getting Started
- Install latest version of docker on your development machine/server. 
    - Linux - https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
    - Mac - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/
    - Windows - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
- Install latest version of docker-compose on your development machine/server (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Clone `git clone https://github.com/1x-eng/PROTON.git & Change directory `cd ~/PROTON/`
- `./cproton.sh -U yes`, please comply to CLI prompts(Use absolute address; not relative for file paths)
- Wait for the platform to bootstrap; once **done**, visit `http://localhost:3000`. 
- Congratulations. you've got your server-side setup!

# Features
- Proton comes with out-of-box support for `Signup` and `Login`. 
- Use `/signup` route to sign up users to platform.
![PROTON_postgres_signup](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_postgres_signup.gif)
- You could swap `db` by changing `db_flavor` in POST payload. Supports `sqlite` & `postgresql`.
-`signup` and `login` validation for free. For example - What happens if 
someone tries to signup with the same email / username?
![PROTON_postgres_signup_validation](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_signup_validation.png)
![PROTON_postgres_login_validation_invalid_username](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_login_invalid_username.png)
![PROTON_postgres_login_validation_invalid_password](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_login_invalid_password.png)
- Use '/login' route to login after successful signup. 
![PROTON_postgres_login](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_postgres_login.gif)
- See the `token` post successful login - That one command to setup the platform has prepared JWT Token 
Authentication with minimum dev effort.
- Prometheus & grafana leveraged for monitoring purposes 
![PROTON_Prom_Grafana](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_Home_Prom_Graf.png)
![Proton_Prometheus](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_Prom.png)
- Ships with a few grafana dashboards out-of-the-box. Visit `localhost:3000/proton-grafana` in your 
favourite browser and login with default credentials:
    - username: admin
    - password: admin
    - You'll be prompted to change and choose your own strong password on first login.
    - `Proton Monitor`

# The MIC stack - What, why & how?

Proton facilitates rapid API development (the <b>M</b>odel <b>I</b>nterface <b>C</b>ontroller stack) with templated code generated by a few CLI commands. 

Why do we need this despite many zillion frameworks? Potentially, to help get away from some of these boring tasks:

- writing; rather, re-writing same boiler plate code everytime you wanted to generate a new API using 
the framework of your choice
- managing database connectivity and dealing with connectivity issues everytime you touch codebase
- configuring cacheing & performance tuning
- configuring logging & monitoring
- authentication & authorization
- container ready backend

# Getting Started

- Generate new API (you can do all CRUD ops on that API) by this one command `./cproton.sh -n myNewApi`
![PROTON_new_mic](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_new_mic.gif)

    - what you see above is an API endpoint auto-generated for the MIC name you provided.
    - a `get` route, `post` route and `concurrency` route.
    - <i>GET call:</i> 
    - ![PROTON_get_call](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_new_mic_get_call.gif)
    - <i>POST call:</i>
    - ![PROTON_post_call](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_post_postgres.gif)
    - And, if you wanted to target sqlite, just change `db_flavour` of your POST `JSON` payload to `sqlite`.
    - ![PROTON_sqlite_post](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_post_sqlite.png)
    - <i>GET call involving Concurrency / Multi-threading</i>
    - ![PROTON_multi_threading](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_concurrency_route.gif)
        - Notice how first call took about 1 second (if not for multi-threading, this takes about 5 seconds) and subsequent
        calls took only 25~35ms. Thanks for cacheing.

- For every new MIC stack that you create (via `cproton.sh -s <your_api_name>`), Proton generates a dedicated controller (to drive CRUD ops):
    - Example: ![PROTON_Controller_Levers](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/NewApiControllerLevers.png)
    
- Deploy using `./cproton.sh -s yes`
 ![PROTON_cproton_update](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_cproton_update_command.png)
 ![PROTON_new_method_route](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_new_method_api.png) 
 ![PROTON_new_method_api_response](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_new_method_api_response.png)
    - Notice how the route considers `id` as a query parameter and results comply to this query parameter.
    - Results from this route also automatically get the best of PROTON in terms of cache support, logging etc.,

- Deleting made easy, while separating concerns.
 ![PROTON_safe_destruction](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_safe_destroy_mic.png)
 ![PROTON_post_safe_destroy](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_post_safe_destroy.png)
    - Notice how `login` and `signup` routes remain unaffected. Similarly, if there were other MIC stacks and you destroyed one of them, 
    all others remain as is; unaffected.

- Access logs here - `./PROTON/trace`
    ![PROTON_logs](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_logs.png)

- OpenAPI specs out-of-the-box
 ![PROTON_swagger_json](https://github.com/PruthviKumarBK/PROTON-Screengrabs/blob/master/PROTON_swagger_json.png)

# Miscellaneous

## Automated Backup & Restoration
- Proton also ships with an ability to backup vitals (secrets + db volume mounts) to cold storage (Dropbox)
- To initiate backup, 
    - Create a dropbox account for yourself and create an app - https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps
        - An example would be:
            - API type - Dropbox API
            - Type of data access as "App folder - Access to a single folder created specifically for your app"
            - App name as "PROTON Backup"
            - Create App & then click on "Generate access token". You'll need this token later.
    - With your access token handy, now navigate to `backup` folder in Proton home directory.
    - Initiate backup using `./scripts/proton_backup_orchestrator.sh`
    - Comply with command line prompts and provide access token when asked for.
    - There is an audit trail just in case. You may `cat` those reports available under `backup/reports` folder.
    
- Similar to backups, Proton also ships with ability to restore from remote dropbox location to your local machine or remote server.
- In order to initiate restoration, ensure you have the access token handy for your remote backup folder and navigate to `backup` folder.
    - Initiate restoration using `./scripts/proton_restore.sh`
    

## PROTON Remote Deployment Instructions - (Considering base machine of Ubuntu-18.04LTS)
- If you have a pre-configured DNS handy, use ` ./deployer.sh -d <your_dns>`
- If you wanted to run the platform for the first time and ok to proceed with defaults; then use: `./deployer.sh -a yes`
- If you were using Proton's backup services, to kickstart restoration use this: `./deployer.sh -r yes`

- ** Prefer manual approach? This could help: **

- [Step - 1] Install Docker and Docker-Compose
```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y docker
    sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose
```
- [Step - 2] Enable USER to run docker
```bash
    sudo groupadd -e docker
    sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} docker
    newgrp docker
```
- [Step - 3] Install NGINX and configure HTTP reverse proxy
```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y nginx
    unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
    cat <<EOT > reverse-proxy.conf
    server {
                    listen 80;
                    listen [::]:80;
                    server_name <dns here>;
    
                    access_log /var/log/nginx/reverse-access.log;
                    error_log /var/log/nginx/reverse-error.log;
    
                    location / {
                                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
                }
            }
    EOT
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/reverse-proxy.conf
    sudo nginx -t
    sudo service nginx restart
```
- [Step - 4] Configure HTTPS in NGINX reverse proxy
```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot -y
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y python-certbot-nginx
    sudo certbot --nginx --non-interactive --agree-tos -m <email> -d <dns eg. temp.com here>
```
- [Step - 5] Grant permission to PROTON Stack
```bash
    cd ~/PROTON
    sudo chmod 777 -R ./
```
- Start Proton stack using - `./cproton.sh -U yes`
